**Requirement Analysis in Software Development.**

Requirement analysis in software development is the process of identifying, gathering, analyzing, and documenting the functional and non-functional requirements of a software system. It’s a critical early phase in the software development lifecycle (SDLC) and serves as the foundation for designing, building, and testing the system.


**What's is Requirement Analysis**

Requirement analysis in software development is the process of identifying, gathering, analyzing, and documenting the functional and non-functional requirements of a software system. It’s a critical early phase in the software development lifecycle (SDLC) and serves as the foundation for designing, building, and testing the system.


**Why is Requirement Analysis Important**

1. Understand Stakeholder Needs
Discover what users, customers, and other stakeholders need from the system.

2. Define Scope Clearly
Determine what the system will and will not do, to avoid scope creep and misunderstandings.

3. Create Requirements Documentation
Produce formal documents like the Software Requirements Specification (SRS), which developers, testers, and project managers can reference.

**Key Activities in Requirement Analysis**


Requirement Gathering

Requirement Elicitation

Requirement Documentation

Requirement Analysis and Modeling

Requirement Validation.


**Types of Requirements**

1. Functional Requirements
What the system should do.
Examples: user login, data processing, reporting.

2. Non-Functional Requirements
How the system should behave.
Examples: performance, reliability, security, usability.

**Accepentance Criteria**

Acceptance Criteria are the predefined conditions that a software product or feature must meet for it to be accepted by a user, customer, or other stakeholders. They act as a checklist to confirm that the requirements have been fully implemented and function correctly.
